# Uninstalling BraDypUS

Uninstalling BraDypUS is as easy as deleting the `BraDypus` directory
created by the git command  or manually downloaded from the
official repository.

Removing **BraDypUS** directory will also remove your application(s) located
in **BraDypUS/projects** folder. If you want to save data and configurations
make a backup of this folder before. You will be able to use your application
with a fresh installation of BraDypUS in the future.
