title: Installing Bradypus locally
---

To install Bradypus locally two different approaches can be followed:
- The [manual download](manual-download) from Github, you will need:
    - a connection to the Internet
    - a web browser
- The [terminal way](terminal), if a Terminal and git are [available](/environment/system-requirements) in the local system, you will need:
    - a connection to the Internet
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - a terminal / command line

The installation with `git` enormously simplifies system updates.
