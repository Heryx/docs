# Knowledge base

For the creation of a new Bradypus database application, 
**no particular knowledge of server settings and/or programming languages is required since in v4**.
Application creation and setup is done via graphical user interfaces (GUI).

Yet, if a manual setup or configuration is needed,
a vary basic knowledge of [JSON](https://www.json.org/),
a simple but powerful format based on Javascript might help, since all 
configuration files of Bradypus are written in JSON. A basic knowledge of
[SLQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) might also help for a more detailed
configuration of the database schema.


Text editors and IDEs like [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
or [Atom](https://atom.io/), among many others, greatly help in fixing typos or
syntax errors.

For the database, GUI tools like 
[SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/) for Sqlite, 
[phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/)for MySQL, or
[pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) for PostgreSQL might help in
creating and editing complex database structures with few or no
knowledge of SQL.
