# Knowledge base

For the creation od the demo dataase, no particular knowledge of servers and programming
languages is required. Yet, a vary basic knowledge of [JSON](https://www.json.org/),
a simle but powerful format based on Javascript might help.
All configuration files of Bradypus are written in JSON. A basic knowledge of
[SLQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) might also help for a more detailed
configuration of the database schema.

Text editors and IDEs like [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
or [Atom](https://atom.io/), among many others, greatly help in fixing typos or
syntax errors.

The same can be said for database managing software, like 
[SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/) for Sqlite, that help in
creating and editing complex database structures with no further
knowledge of SQL.
