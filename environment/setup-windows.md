Windows operating system does not ship usually with a PHP installation, wich 
must be installe manually. The [official documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.windows.php) 
is a good starting point for information.

If a more robust and easy to use working environment is required, the following
solutions are both easy to use and open source, and permit to install and manage 
from a graphical interface several servers, databases and languages:
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)
- [WampServer](http://www.wampserver.com/)
- [WAMP](https://www.mamp.info/)
- [Uniform Server](http://www.uniformserver.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose)
