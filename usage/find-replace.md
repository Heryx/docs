{: .callout-block .callout-block-warning }
This feature is available only for edit enabled users and above

It is easy to look for a string and replace it with another string 
in all the records of a table, without having to edit records one by one.

Dropdown menus will help selecting the table, and the column, then
you can type the term to search for and the string to use as replacement 
for the found term.

{: .callout-block .callout-block-danger }
Be aware, once the replace has been perfomed, there is no way back.
Please make a [database backup](/usage/backup) before going through this procedure.
