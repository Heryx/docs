This documentation is aimed to be the complete guide to the installation, configuration, deploy,
management, and develoment of BraDypUS, a web-based relational database managing system.

In this guide **BDUS** is used as a short form of **BraDypUS**; the terms are equivalent.

### Version
The guide is dedicated to the still immature version **4.0.0**, which is a major an almost total
rescript of the whole application with few, but remarkable, new features.
Read the [migration guide](/migration-from-v3) for more information.

### Target users
The guide is written both for expert users, who are very confortable with web technologies
and for inexperienced ones, who just want to setup an efficient web database service.

### Local test
Some information will be provided on how to setup a local development environment,
but this part is mainly left to the user. Only minimal requirements will be introduced,
aiming at having a basic but working local setup.
