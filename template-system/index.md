Configuration files are all you need to get out of the box
a working environment with user-friendly templates to read
and input your data.

Typically a two column layout is available, with the images
and data-table columns on the left and links,
geodata, plugin-tables and permalinks on the left.

However you can write your own template files to replace the 
default ones.
